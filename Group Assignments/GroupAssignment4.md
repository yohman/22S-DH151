# Group Assignment #4 Presentation rehearsal

Your fourth (and final!) group assignment is for the group to meet with me and rehearse your final presentation. Make sure to schedule a time as listed in the [week 9 home page](/Weeks/Week09/readme.md). 

Your project must incorporate additional interactivity in the form of data charts, tables, sliders, etc. You are welcome to use the materials from the week 9 lab and adapt it to your project, or experiment with other libraries to create interactivity that informs your specific project needs. Consult with me if in doubt.

Recommended libraries. Note that you are not limited to these and are free to propose other libraries that better suit your project needs:

## Charts

- https://apexcharts.com/
- https://www.chartjs.org/
- https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/index.html
- https://developers.google.com/chart (not open source but free)

## Tables

- https://gridjs.io/docs/examples/import-json
- http://js-grid.com/getting-started/

## Sliders
- http://ionden.com/a/plugins/ion.rangeSlider/

## Timelines and network graphs
- https://visjs.org/

Submit a fully functional maproom that incorporates the following:
- User action (hover/click) that triggers the creation of a chart, OR
- User action on an interactive element outside of the map (like a table or slider) that changes the map in some way
