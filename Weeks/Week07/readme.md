Next week, [Alesha Unpingco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleshaunpingco/) will be our guest speaker. Alesha is a former Bruin, now working for Apple (previously Google) as a UX designer. Her undergarduate major? English literature. Find out how she made the jump as an English Lit major at UCLA to the echelon of design-based employment at Google and Apple.

Your individual assignment for this week is to come up with one or two engaging and insightful questions for Alesha. What would you want to ask somebody who was in your shoes some 10 or so years ago and now works as a UX/web designer for Apple?
