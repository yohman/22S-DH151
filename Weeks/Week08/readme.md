## Assignments

### Individual Assignment: Thinking Cap on "Critical Cartography"

Read the following article.

Harley, J. B. (1989). Deconstructing the map. Cartographica: The international journal for geographic information and geovisualization, 26(2), 1-20. This is a classic text by Brian Harley – one of the first Foucauldian analyses of mapping.
https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext

Reflect on the article. Write down your thoughts. You are not asked to answer all these questions, but here are some prompts: What concerns you? How has your thinking about maps, cartography, and GIS shifted... or not? What do you think of your responsibility as a steward to your maps?

Submit your thinking cap [here](https://github.com/yohman/22S-DH151/discussions/17).
