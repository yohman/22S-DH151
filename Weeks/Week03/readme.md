# Assignments

## Thinking Cap

What is UX design?

Read the following article ["Introduction to UXD"](https://medium.com/beakerandflint/an-introduction-user-experience-design-2a7f8167bf03) and watch the following video ["what is user experience design?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj6x01wg2WA). Write a short reaction piece directly into the discussion submission link below.

- Submit your assignment [here](https://github.com/yohman/22S-DH151/discussions/6)

## Individual Coding Assignment

Complete the in-class lab, and submit your finalized Story Map. Your Story Map should include (but not limited to) the following elements:

- A fully functional interactive map
- "Data" driven narrative, using a javascript object with key:value pairs that generate the markers, narratives, links, and images as necessary on the map
- A data-driven sidebar with clickable elements that help navigate the map-based narrative
- At least one additional feature that is not covered in the lab that makes your map "different." This could be a unique design/layout of the site, or it could be a functionality component that adds to the user experience. Be creative!
- Submit your assignment [here](https://github.com/yohman/22S-DH151/discussions/7)

## Group progress:

Meet with your group and submit a blog style entry on progress made this week. For example:

- document any insightful sites you found and describe why it inspires you; 
- describe in more detail the datasets you plan to use, and how; 
- begin to articulate what the site will look like; 
- report responsitilities and progress made by each group member;
- describe your hopes on how the site will help a particular cause; 
- include images, photos, sketches to visually enhance your post;

Submit your group progress [here](https://github.com/yohman/22S-DH151/discussions/8)


## Reading assignment:

Note: Reading assigments are mandatory. While there will be no quizzes or submission requirements, future labs are designed under the assumption that you have read and understood the materials in the readings.
