# Assignments

## Thinking Cap

What is UX design?

Read the following article ["Introduction to UXD"](https://medium.com/beakerandflint/an-introduction-user-experience-design-2a7f8167bf03) and watch the following video ["what is user experience design?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj6x01wg2WA). Write a short reaction piece directly into the discussion submission link below.

- Submit your assignment [here](https://github.com/yohman/22S-DH151/discussions/6)

## Individual Coding Assignment

Complete the in-class lab, and submit your finalized Story Map. Your Story Map should include (but not limited to) the following elements:

- A fully functional interactive map
- "Data" driven narrative, using a javascript object with key:value pairs that generate the markers, narratives, links, and images as necessary on the map
- A data-driven sidebar with clickable elements that help navigate the map-based narrative
- At least one additional feature that is not covered in the lab that makes your map "different." This could be a unique design/layout of the site, or it could be a functionality component that adds to the user experience. Be creative!
- Submit your assignment [here](https://github.com/yohman/22S-DH151/discussions/7)

## Group progress:

Meet with your group and submit a blog style entry on progress made this week. For example:

- document any insightful sites you found and describe why it inspires you; 
- describe in more detail the datasets you plan to use, and how; 
- begin to articulate what the site will look like; 
- report responsitilities and progress made by each group member;
- describe your hopes on how the site will help a particular cause; 
- include images, photos, sketches to visually enhance your post;

Submit your group progress [here](https://github.com/yohman/22S-DH151/discussions/8)


## Reading assignment:
