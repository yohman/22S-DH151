## Assignments

### Individual assignment: Provide feedback to two midterm projects

Go to the discussion section and navigate to the [midterm assignments](https://github.com/yohman/22S-DH151/discussions/13). Provide feedback to **two other midterm projects**, making sure to include the following:

- What you liked about the project. Be specific!
- What you recommend the project can work on/improve on for the final (features, additional layers, design/interactive components, improved layout, narrative flow, etc)

Do not provide feedback to a project that already has more than six comments!

### Thinking cap

Topic: Design Justice

Read [Design Justice: towards an intersectional feminist framework for design theory and practice](https://github.com/albertkun/21S-ASIAAM-191A/blob/main/Week_6/Materials/Design_Justice.pdf)

Submit a "thinking cap" reaction to the reading. Specifically, discuss the following:

- How does the topic of design justice influence you personally, based on your own lived experiences?

Be prepared to share your reactions to the class next week.
